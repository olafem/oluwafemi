### [Project 1: Predictive Modeling of THC Values based on CBN Results for Distillates](https://www.kaggle.com/code/femiolawale/distillate-potency-prediction?scriptVersionId=145139556)

Overview 
- In this project, we have successfully addressed the pressing issue of THC inflation in the cannabis industry by developing a highly accurate predictive model that utilizes Cannabinol (CBN) values to predict delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) content in cannabis distillates. With a remarkable 92% accuracy rate and well within the margin of error, this model not only serves as a robust check against inflated THC data generated by testing laboratories but also identifies instances where THC values deviate from expected norms. By doing so, it provides a vital quality assurance mechanism for testing laboratories, promotes transparency, and empowers industry stakeholders to make informed decisions. This innovative approach not only safeguards consumer trust and satisfaction but also contributes to the establishment of rigorous industry standards, ensuring the continued growth and integrity of the cannabis market.
